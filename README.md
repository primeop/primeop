## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I’m Kamalesh — a passionate cybersecurity engineer blending **cloud defense** with **offensive techniques**.  
I thrive at the intersection of **DevSecOps**, **cloud infra**, and **hands-on pentesting**.

Currently, I’m a **Research Assistant at USC**, exploring how satellites can be secured using cutting-edge cyber strategies — including **Zero Trust in space** 🚀.

## ☁️ Cloud Security Intern – Keck Medicine of USC

- Designed and deployed **centralized AWS security architecture** using GuardDuty, Security Hub, and CloudWatch.  
- Automated incident response with **Python-based Lambda functions**, cutting manual triage by 80%.  
- Developed reusable **Terraform modules** and **AWS Config rules** for policy-as-code enforcement.  
- Engineered **compliance pipelines** aligned with HIPAA, HITRUST, FedRAMP, and CMMC standards.  
- Enhanced **CSPM posture** and reduced security misconfigurations across multi-cloud environments (AWS + Azure).

## 🛰️ Satellite Cybersecurity Research @ USC

- 🔍 Investigating replay, DDoS, and spoofing attacks in satellite-ground communication.
- 🌐 Simulating orbits using **Cesium** and **TLE** data in 3D.
- 🛡 Applying **Zero Trust Architecture** to space communication networks.
- 🧠 Threat modeling with the **SPARTA framework** + PoC development.
- 🛰️ Researching ground-origin attack vectors (AWS Ground Station, uplinks, spoofed telemetry).
