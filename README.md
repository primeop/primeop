## 👨‍💻 About Me

Cybersecurity Graduate Student | Cloud Security + Offensive Engineering

I’m currently pursuing my M.S. in Cybersecurity at the University of Southern California (USC), specializing in cloud security and offensive engineering. At Keck Medicine of USC, I serve as an Information Security Intern, where I design scalable AWS security architectures, automate incident response, and enforce multi-cloud compliance (HIPAA, HITRUST, FedRAMP).

Previously, I spent 2+ years as a Cloud Engineer at Oracle, leading secure cloud migrations, DevSecOps integration, and IAM implementations for enterprise clients across JAPAC.

Outside of work, I actively participate in CTFs, adversary emulation, and exploit development — blending both red and blue team skills to strengthen system defenses.
